TODO

• Establish Firebase connection

• build recipe input with user authentication

• build login page

• input recipes 

• finish homepage/search page

• enable search functionality

• truncated search results, potentially with http://dotdotdot.frebsite.nl/

• implement "branding" elements: images, logos, relevant & consistent visual cues

• enable search functionality by creating a page that pulls results from firebase. This will recall recipe items, located in divs/etc., that are chosen through some selection logic in JS that relates the recipe to the search query. 

• add search function to 'enter' key-up on main page

• The nutrition API can deliver information by specific ingredient with an on.click, it can displa information for say 5-6, or all, ingredients in another dropdown like "ingredients", "the story", etc. If the JSON has a "caution", like a food allergy, it might be useful to display that information in the recipe page

//I'd like to give the unordered lists a data-attribute with a value that represents the ingredient listed inside. Ingredient by itself, not including the measurement, etc. Adding the nutritional value by presented measurement could be an interesting little math project.

//develop search results
