TODO

• Establish Firebase connection
• build recipe input with user authentication
• build login page
• input recipes 
• finish homepage/search page
• enable search functionality
• truncated search results, potentially with http://dotdotdot.frebsite.nl/
• implement "branding" elements: images, logos, relevant & consistent visual cues
• enable search functionality by creating a page that pulls results from firebase. This will recall recipe items, located in divs/etc., that are chosen through some selection logic in JS that relates the recipe to the search query.
